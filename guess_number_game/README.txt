# Number Guessing Game

A simple Python program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number.

## Functionality

- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- Prompts the user to enter their guess.
- Validates the user's input to ensure it's a number between 1 and 100.
- Provides feedback to the user if their guess is higher or lower than the generated number.
- Terminates the game and displays the number of attempts taken when the user guesses the correct number.

## Usage

1. Run the program using Python.
2. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
3. The program will prompt you to enter your guess.
4. Enter your guess as a number between 1 and 100.
5. The program will provide feedback based on your guess:
   - If your guess is lower than the generated number, it will display "guess higher".
   - If your guess is higher than the generated number, it will display "guess lower".
   - If your guess is correct, the program will terminate and display the number of attempts taken.
6. After the program terminates, you can run it again to play another round.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Example

```
Enter your guess between 1 to 100: 50
```
Output:
```
Guess higher
```

```
Enter your guess between 1 to 100: 75
```
Output:
```
Guess lower
```

```
Enter your guess between 1 to 100: 63
```
Output:
```
Bingo, Got that right in 3 attempts
```
